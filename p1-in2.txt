Brown shoes don't make it!
Brown shoes don't make it!
Quit school, why fake it?
Brown shoes don't make it?
TV dinner by the pool
Watch your brother grow a beard
Got another year of school
You're OK, he's too weird
Be a plumber, He's a bummer
He's a bummer, every summer
Be a loyal plastic robot
For a world that doesn't care!!
Smile at every ugly
Shine on your shoes and cut your hair
Be a jerk and go to work, Be a jerk and go to work
Be a jerk and go to work, Be a jerk and go to work
Do your job, and do it right
Life's a ball! (TV tonight!)
Do you love it, do you hate it?
There it is, the way you made it (WOOOooow)
