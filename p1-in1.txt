Clemson coach Dabo Swinney might need to consider moving Ohio State into the 
top 10 of his Coaches Poll ballot next week after No. 3 Ohio State dominated 
No. 2 Clemson 49-28 in the 2021 Sugar Bowl semifinal behind a heroic performance 
from quarterback Justin Fields. The junior signal caller thrilled by completing 
22 of 28 passes for 385 yards and a Sugar Bowl-record six touchdowns with more 
highlights than one could count as Ohio State advanced to the College Football 
Playoff National Championship.
